> Globally, we have 3 Units in Data Science, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course.

## _CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

> Timeline: _Lessons 10 - 18 will be complete by mid-February._

Our lessons contain objectives, prerequisites, sugggested datasets, starter and solution code, and other instructional resources, tying into the overall competencies for each unit. See below for a complete description of all the lesson planning material we provide.

> Instructors should review our [preparatory instructions](../resources/instructor-resources/instructor-prep.md) or read up on our [feedback guidelines](../resources/instructor-resources/course-feedback-guidelines.md) to find out how we provide feedback to students.


General Assembly's Data Science course is made up of 20 lessons that are 3 hours each. This course is split into 3 units.

## Available Materials

We've supplied a folder for each lesson. Each folder includes the following:

|Materials | Description | How to Use It|
|----|---------|---------------|
| __readme.md__| Topic break down and suggested lesson schedule. | Use this to get a high level view, including information on lesson content, in-class activities, objectives, prework, and projects.|
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for that lesson.| You should share this folder with students before every lesson. Make the necessary changes if you are using different code.|

| __Solution Folder__| This is a folder with all solutions to code alongs and exercises| Share individual solution files as needed. Student should be provided with code demo solutions before lab time to use as a reference.|
| __Project Prompts__| Instructions for completing unit projects | Each project folder includes a prompt with starter and solution code (if applicable) and a rubric. Share the project requirements as early as possible.|

### Folder Navigation
Each lesson folder is organized in the following pattern:

- **Lesson**: includes the root lesson plan readme
  - _Code_ supplemental code
    - **Starter Code**: iPython notebook for demos, as well as questions for guided and independent practice
    - **Solution Code**: iPython notebook with answers to questions from guided and independent practice
  - _Assets_
    - **Dataset**: Includes or links to the dataset(s) used during demo, guided, and independent practice
    - **Images**: Includes or links to any images referenced
    - **Slides**: Includes and links to the baseline lesson deck for you to modify
