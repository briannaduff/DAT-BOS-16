# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project, Part 5: Final Presentation

### PROMPT
**Context & Takeaway:**

This is it! This presentation is your way of showing what you've learned to a non-technical audience. Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science! That's why it's important to practice communicating clearly and effectively so that anyone can understand.

The output here will be a 10 minute presentation that guides your viewers through the problem, original data and hypothesis, findings, and results. This is what you've been building toward over the past few weeks - and indeed, over the entire course! You should already have most of the actual analytical work complete - now it's time to clean up your findings!

After you present your work, you'll participate in a short Q/A session (roughly two minutes) with your peers--both fellow students and instructors--about your project.

**Goal:** A slide deck that describes your analysis and findings to a non-technical audience.

### DELIVERABLES
**Project Requirements & Constraints**

#### Final Presentation
- **Requirements:**
  * Show off your work to what would be a less technical, more business oriented audience
  * Summarize the work you've completed from earlier deliverables into a clean presentation, including:
    * Your project's background, problem and hypothesis
    * Descriptions of the datasets you used
    * Data exploration with summary and charts
    * An explanation of your model (for non-technical audiences)
    * Recommendations based on your findings
    * An appendix that includes all of your work and technical terminology
  * Review next steps with your audience; what could you do beyond the scope of this course?

- **Breakdown:**
    * A 10 to 20 slide deck consisting of:
        * *1 Outline Slide*
            - What is your project about?
            - What is its history?
            - What relevant information is required for a colleague to jump in to understand your project?
        * *2-3 Summary Slides* (including data and problem statement)
            - What were you trying to accomplish?
            - What steps did your project take?
            - Where did the data come from? What does a sample look like? Was there data you considered but decided to remove?
        * *3-4 Modeling Insight Slides*
            - What is the visualization explaining?
            - What do the x and y axes mean?
            - How does the visualization help either prove or disprove your work?
            - What caveats have to be explained to best understand it?
        * *2-3 Modeling Approach Slides*
            - What was your model trying to optimize for? Why was it the right metric for optimization?
            - What algorithm did you try? How does it work?  
        * *2-3 Results Slides*
            - What worked? What didn't? Why?
        * *1-2 Conclusion Slides*
            - What had the most impact on your work?
            - What can you confirm? What can you suggest? What is still to be determined?
        * *1-2 Next Steps Slides*
            - What should this project do moving forward?
            - What would be the next two or three things you want to try? What impact might they have?
            - What might your conclusions enable others to do?

- **Submission:**	
  - Final format and submission location are TBD by instructor.

- **Bonus:**
    * An Acknowledgements Slide is always a good idea :)
    * You might also include a Citations Slide, if necessary

### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 
Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Refine
2. Build
3. Present

**Rubric**: [Link to rubric](#). Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of **9** points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While the overall rubric will serve as a helpful gauge of whether you met project goals, your __specific scores are more important__ since they can help you identify where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES
**Examples & Suggestions**

#### Project Tips
- Limit the amount of visuals and text on your slides for maximum clarity.
    - For instance, try not to use more than 2 visuals or 3-5 bullets per slide.
- Clean & informative presentations > Fancy Presentations!
- Keep your charts simple, and make sure they are clearly labeled.

#### Starter Code 
- Refer to the [presentation template](../02-experiment-writeup/project-design-template.md) as a blueprint for how to organize your work.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started
- A quick outline (e.g. "what do I need" and "where can I find it") can help you prepare.
- Practice your presentation with a friend or family member! Outside feedback can help you identify gaps in your material.

#### Links to Past Projects
- You can find previous General Assembly Presentations and Notebooks at the [GA Gallery](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=)

### Useful Resources
- Presentations from [PyData](http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/presentations)
- Presentations from [DataGotham](https://www.youtube.com/user/DataGotham), a shortly-ran data conference in NYC.
- [Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html#scaling-plot-elements-with-plotting-context-and-set-context) has a handy easy way to set figures into a "talk" context, which blows up the text and makes it easier to read.
