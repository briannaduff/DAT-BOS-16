> The Final Project is divided into 5 deliverables, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course.

Each project deliverable includes objectives, requirements, starter-code, rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for this course.

<!-- See the [feedback guidelines](../project-feedback.md) to read more about how we provide feedback to students. -->


### **Final Project, pt. 1**

In the field of data science, projects are practical. A good project is manageable and relates to your working domain; however, it can be hard to filter and scope good ideas when you're new to a field. One of the best ways to test expectations and get feedback is to share your ideas with others. For part one of your final project, you'll come up with a few different ideas you could potentially solve with data, then present them in small groups to the class.

- **Goal**: Prepare a one-minute lightning talk that covers 3 potential project topics.

### **Final Project, pt. 2**

Project outlines are a valuable resource when working through data projects. For this project, you will need to complete a problem statement and research design outline for the topic you chose from pt. 1. This will serve as the starting point for your modeling approach. Make sure to include a specific aim and hypthesis, well-defined risks and assumptions, and clearly articulated goals and success metrics.

- **Goal**: Create an outline of your research design approach, including hypothesis, assumptions, goals, and success metrics.

### **Final Project, pt. 3**

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial and informative step in the data process. In this assignment, you will build off of your previous work, by first confirming a dataset, then exploring and visualizing your analysis in order to effectively tell your data's story. You'll create an iPython notebook that explores your data mathematically, using a python visualiation package.

- **Goal**: Confirm your data and create an exploratory analysis notebook with stat analysis and visualization.

### **Project Project, pt. 4**

Students will get to call the shots and come up with their own idea, choosing tools that are appropriate for what they're looking to build.

For this project, students will be working with a team and using product development strategies to come up with a project proposal that will be reviewed with the instructional team; this it to make sure the team's proposal is something that can be accomplish in the time left in the course while also making sure it's something that will challenge students.

- **Goal**: Do user research and use product development methods to pitch an idea that will turn into a working Android app
