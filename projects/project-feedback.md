> _Every student should have the chance to understand how they're doing, and get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors like us._

## Guiding Principles

**The goal of providing feedback on student projects is to give personal guidance to each student, including meaningful suggestions and input that isn’t immediately obvious.**
- **Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project prompt**
- The rubric is based on a **simple 3-point scale**
- **The actual measurement for “meets expectation” is tied to the project prompt, and will be different by project**

## Instructor Process

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

<!-- #### 1. Fill Out a Project Evaluation

**Each instructor should provide feedback for a subset of their students**, so we can split up the workload between instructors. Work with your producer & city leads to figure out who's helping which students.

**For each student you are assigned, fill out a project evaluation**. Make a duplicate of this [template](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/document/d/1ezYm6cHlwJws7ASheKme-IjwfQSMn2S8xmWcZRSB1V8/edit?usp=sharing) and bring it to the conversation you have with the student.

> **Note:** Scores like 1.5 are okay, but there's no sense in getting crazy – a score like 1.78 is too detailed to know how to handle as a student.

**You may want to leave the “problem solving” row blank until you meet with the student,** so you can give the student the chance to defend their solution during your conversation.

#### 2. In-Person Code Review

**Each student should have 30 minutes to review their project evaluation and do a code review with an instructor sometime during the week after a project is completed.**

*Make sure you frame this time to the students* – this is not troubleshooting time, we’re just reviewing code and talking about actionable feedback for enhancing the project in the future.

- **Student** *(10 mins)*:  Have the student walk through and defend their code.

- **Student** *(10 mins)*:  Have the student answer the following questions.

  - What do you like most about your app?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?


Aside from the rubrics, send students an email to talk through the evaluation, and share a “glow and grow”:

  - Make it personal – what about the app was exciting or intriguing for you?
  - Share highlights and positive areas (“glow”) where the student went “above and beyond” the requirements
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, project approach (if any)
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate difficulties the student encountered
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. **Set 1 or 2 specific goals for the next project.** If you’re reviewing later projects, you may want to ask them how they did against the goals they set previously!

**Be sure to report a summary of your evaluations back to your team and producer.** Everyone should be able to have a good idea of how the whole class is doing if we split it up and share our findings! -->
