> _Every student should have the chance to understand how they're doing, and get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors like us._

## Guiding Principles

**The goal of providing feedback on student projects is to give personal guidance to each student, including meaningful suggestions and input that isn’t immediately obvious.**

- **Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project prompt**
- The rubric is based on a **simple 3-point scale**
- **The actual measurement for “meets expectation” is tied to the project prompt, and will be different by project**
