## Types of Projects
Our PT DS course includes two types of projects - unit projects and a final project. There are 4 unit projects and 1 final project; however, the final project is subdivided into 5 sections in order to space out student deliverables.

1. [Unit Projects](projects/unit-projects)

2. [Final Projects](projects/final-projects)
