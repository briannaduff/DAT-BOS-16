> Globally, we have 4 Unit Projects and 1 Final Project (subdivided into 5 deliverables). Each builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance over the entire course.

## Project Specs
Each project includes objectives, requirements, starter-code, rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files to read more about each project.

See the [feedback guidelines](./project-feedback.md) to read more about how we provide feedback to students.
