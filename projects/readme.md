> Globally, we have 4 Unit Projects and 1 Final Project (subdivided into 5 deliverables). Each builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance over the entire course.

## Project Specs

Each project includes objectives, requirements, starter-code, rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files to read more about each project.

See the [feedback guidelines](./project-feedback.md) to read more about how we provide feedback to students.

### Grading & Using GitHub in the Classroom

You should be using GitHub for student-facing materials, project submission, feedback, and grading.

In addition to your own instructional instance repo, we recommend setting up a separate student-facing repo for the course. For information on [how to set up a student-facing repo see these instructions](../resources/instructor-resources/github-repo-instance-guide.md).
