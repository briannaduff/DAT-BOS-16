> Globally, we have 4 Unit Projects in DS and 1 Final Project (subdivided into 5 deliverables), each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course.

Each project has an objective, deliverables, and recommendations - all of which tie into the overall competencies we focus on in each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec file to read more about each project and [read about our curriculum](#)

See the [feedback guidelines](#) to read more about how we provide feedback to students.
