# _Curriculum Refresh In Progress_

Welcome! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems. Here is our timeline:

- **Feb 1**: Lesson Build Complete
- **Feb 29th**: Lesson QA Complete

### DS Curriculum Repo

Included in this Repository:

1. **Lessons** - lesson plans and corresponding assets, including starter & solution code, datasets, & slide decks.
2. **Projects** - instructions and materials for both UNIT and FINAL projects, including starter code, rubrics, and datasets.
3. **Resources** - various supplementary instructor and student facing resources, including syllabus & prework.
4. **Templates** - GA campus educational styleguides with templates and examples for lessons and projects.


#### â‘ƒ Forking and Collaborating

The structure of this repository provides a way for us to organize our information and use the same vocabulary.

Some cities maintain forks of this repository for collaboration by their local instructors. However, we also encourage the teaching team for each cohort to fork this repository directly, and use it to store your new and improved resources. By the end of the course, we hope you'll have some things to submit to make our curriculum better.

If you have any questions about the organization of resources, or about the scope of the DS curriculum, feel free to open an issue.

Please check out our [contributing guidelines](contributing.md) for more details.

Welcome to the Data Science Curriculum v2.0!

We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems.

## DS Curriculum

This repository contains all the materials GA supplies to Data Science instructors. Bear in mind that _some of the files in this repo are meant to be instructor-facing only_.  

General Assembly's Data Science course is split into three units, made up of 20 lessons that are 3 hours each.

## Unit Breakdown

| Class | Title | Project Prompt | Project Deadline|
| --- | :---: |  --- | :---: |
| **Unit 1: Research Design & Exploratory Data Analysis** | Lessons 1 - 5  | Slackbot: Introduced by end of Lesson 3| Slackbot: Due before start of Lesson 5|
| **Unit 2: Foundations of Modeling** | Lessons 6 - 11 | Feedr: Introduced at the end of Lesson 10 and during Lesson 11 Lab Time| Feedr: Due before start of Lesson 14 |
| **Unit 3: Data Science in the Real World**| Lessons 12 - 18 |Final Project: Introduced at end of Lesson 13| |

## Available Materials

We've supplied a folder for each week and lesson. In these folders we've included:

|Materials | Description | How to Use It|
|----|---------|---------------|
| __readme.md__| Topic break down and suggested schedule. | Use this to get a high level view of the week, including information on the lesson plan, in-class labs and final project milestones.|
| __Code Alongs/ Demos__| Code to be used by instructors to help demonstrate a concept.|These are exercises included in the lesson plans where you'll demonstrate a concept in class while students follow along on their machines. Type slowly and explain the concepts, pausing at regular intervals to check for understanding.|
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for that lesson.| You should share this folder with students before every lesson. Make the necessary changes if you are using different code.|
| __Solution Folder__| This is a folder with all solutions to code alongs and exercises| Share individual solution files as needed. Student should be provided with code demo solutions before lab time to use as a reference.|
| __Project Prompts__| Instructions for completing unit projects | Each project folder includes a prompt with starter and solution code (if applicable) and a rubric. Share the project requirements as early as possible.|


## Pre-Course Responsibilities

We __highly recommend__ you begin preparing your lessons before the course starts. You should start prepping to teach the materials 4 - 6 weeks prior to course launch. A good benchmark is to prepare the first 5 - 6 lessons before the course begins.

During these preparation weeks you should:

*	Create slide decks for each lesson to correspond with what you plan to teach.

*	Review the sample and solution code for each lesson and assignment and make sure you agree with the way it was coded. If not, you can always make tweaks to the code. Keep in mind the students' level of understanding but __don't share code you don't agree with__.

*	Review all curriculum materials and think about how you would like to apply your teaching style and professional experience to the classroom.

#### How To Prepare For Each Lesson

1.	Read the weekly README, and take a look at the starter and solution code.

2.	Review the lesson agenda schedule and learning objectives. Become familiar with what we would like students to accomplish during a particular lesson.

3.	Dive into the lesson planning notes.

4.	View the solution file, and make sure you agree with the solutions. If you don't, change it before you share with students. Students want to feel like you are in command of all materials you share with them.

5.	Decide how you will bring your expertise to the classroom and what materials you will have to edit in order to incorporate any additions or changes you are planning to make to the lesson.

6.	If you prefer not to use the GA-provided code alongs/in-class exercises, create your own and make sure they hit the same topics and learning objectives for that lesson. If you do build new exercises, please share your work with the curriculum team by sending a pull-request to this repo. We are actively working to build the best curriculum we can and are always happy to consider contributions from instructors!

7.	Creating slides? Practice using reveal.js. It can be tricky to get the hang of the workflow (see below).
> Note: Slides are currently not provided in the curriculum, but creating them is a great way to start planning for your lessons. We suggest using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) to present slides to the class.

*	We suggest using reveal.js with external markdown.

*	Any text following the line `Note:` in a given slide will not appear in the presented deck. However, when you share the rendered markdown (i.e as a pdf), students will see the notes. This is a great place to put presenter notes and additional information you would like students to read outside of class.

*	See [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for further documentation about Reveal.js.

#### Assignments and Projects

In order to pass this course General Assembly students must:

*	Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.

	*	Students will receive feedback from instructors on their assignments within 2 - 4 days.

*	Complete and submit the course [final project](curriculum/projects/readme.md), including all milestones.

Grading, Hosting and Using GitHub in the Classroom

We'll use GitHub for student-facing materials, homework submission, final project hosting, feedback and grading.

* Students will learn Git and GitHub early on in lesson 1.

* In order to host their final projects online, students will use GitHub pages. Unit 4 will cover the process of getting their site up and running on GitHub pages or Heroku.

* Producers should set up a student-facing repo for the course which will be handed-off to the instructional team. For information on how to set up a student-facing repo [see these instructions](NEED INSTRUCTIONS).


#### Exit Tickets

As part of an initiative to collect targeted, topic-based feedback - and encourage our instructors to reflect on their teaching practices - a group of NYC instructors are piloting instructor exit tickets. These short surveys should be completed at the end of each lesson or the end of each day. The link to the survey can be found [here](ADD TICKET).
