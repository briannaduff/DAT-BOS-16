A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

We here at GA care about both our Mac and PC users! If you are using a PC (or Linux machine), you may need to follow some additional steps to get your environment running correctly. 

Compatibility Issues: Python and Anacondas have some known issues with Windows 7 x64 machines. If you are running this OS, we recommend installing a virtual machine in order to run Anacondas correctly.
